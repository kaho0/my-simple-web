    <p>Islam is a strictly monotheistic religion,
  <br>and its adherents, called Muslims, 
    <br>regard the Prophet Muhammad as the 
    <br>last and most perfect of God's messengers, 
    <br>who include Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and others. 
    <br>The sacred scripture of Islam is the Qurʾān, which 
    <br>contains God's revelations to Muhammad.</p>
